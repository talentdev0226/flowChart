## Feedback / Backend Functionality

This app sends emails using Sendgrid and Vercel's serverless functions.

It's possible to run this app without the feedback functionality, but if you do wish to run it with the feedback functionality you will need to deploy it on vercel and set the `REACT_APP_FEEDBACK_TO` and `SENDGRID_API_KEY` environment variables.
