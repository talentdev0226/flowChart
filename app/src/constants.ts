  new lines create new nodes
    indentation creates child nodes

  [linking] you can link to nodes using their ID in parentheses
    like this: (1)
    lines have a default ID of their line-number
      but you can also supply a custom ID in brackets
        like this: (linking) // use single line comments
/*
or 
multiline 
comments

Have fun! ðŸŽ‰
